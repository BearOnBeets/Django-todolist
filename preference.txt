Flask was easier to use but django certainly felt more powerful.Having a seperate file for url,views,model would be very helpful when creating sites with many pages.
Here the site only had 2 pages so it was not that useful but i can clearly see myself preferring django over flask when making abstruse websites.
Flask is relatively very simple but once you get the hang of django it makes understanding the routing process of a site very easy as everything is well articulated into different files.
Also the ability of creating different applications within a single project seems useful.
In summary,for this particular site I would prefer flask but if i was making a little complex website,i would use django.
